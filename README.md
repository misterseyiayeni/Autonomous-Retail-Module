Autonomous Retail Module (ARM) for Loss Prevention.

## The Three Core Stages of the ARM System

Think of the architecture in three logical layers, each with a distinct responsibility:

### Stage 1: Ingestion & Sensing (The Eyes)

- Function: To see everything happening in the store and securely transport that visual data to the cloud.

### Stage 2: Real-time Analysis & Decision (The Brain)

- Function: To process the visual data, understand what's happening, and decide if an event is suspicious.

### Stage 3: Alerting & Response (The Voice & Hands)

- Function: To take immediate action based on the AI's decision, notifying the right people and logging the event for review.
